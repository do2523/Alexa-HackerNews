**Alexa Skill with Top News Presentation**

This code sample demonstrates the development of an Alexa skill using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Python. The script incorporates intent handlers for various interactions, including a specialized "GetTopNewsIntent" handler that employs web scraping with the Beautiful Soup library to retrieve and present top news articles from the Hacker News website.

## Overview

This repository provides a practical example of building an Alexa skill using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Python. It showcases the implementation of intent handlers to manage user interactions and includes a custom handler, "GetTopNewsIntent," that employs web scraping techniques, assisted by the Beautiful Soup library, to fetch and deliver the latest top news articles from Hacker News.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Alexa Developer Account
- Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Python (ask-sdk-core)
- Beautiful Soup (bs4)
- Requests Library (requests)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the `alexa_skill_script.py` file in a text editor or integrated development environment.
4. Customize or extend the intent handlers to match your desired skill features.
5. Execute the script, which will establish a local server to handle incoming Alexa skill requests.
6. Create a new skill using the Alexa Developer Console, and configure it to use the provided script as the backend.
7. Set up the skill's interaction model, endpoints, and other relevant settings in the Alexa Developer Console.
8. Test the skill using an Alexa-enabled device or simulator, triggering various intents, including "GetTopNewsIntent."

## Intent Handlers

- `LaunchRequestHandler`: Greets users with a welcome message upon skill launch.
- `HelloWorldIntentHandler`: Responds with a simple "Hello World!" message.
- `HelpIntentHandler`: Offers users assistance and guidance.
- `CancelOrStopIntentHandler`: Concludes the session with a friendly goodbye message.
- `FallbackIntentHandler`: Provides guidance when user input is unclear.
- `SessionEndedRequestHandler`: Performs necessary cleanup when the session ends.
- `GetTopNewsIntentHandler`: Employs Beautiful Soup and web scraping to retrieve and present top news articles from Hacker News.
- `IntentReflectorHandler`: Echoes the triggered intent for debugging purposes.
- `CatchAllExceptionHandler`: Handles general errors and informs users to retry.

## Acknowledgments

This code example draws inspiration from the official Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Python documentation. It serves as a valuable reference for creating voice-controlled applications with web scraping capabilities using the Beautiful Soup library.

Please note that while this script is intended for educational purposes, further adjustments and customization may be required for production-ready usage.
